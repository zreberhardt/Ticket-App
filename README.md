The Ticket Tracker App is developed using Next.js, incorporating React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. The application features an API built with MySQL and utilizes Prisma as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.


The primary functionality of the app revolves around real-time tracking of ticket creation and management. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tickets through the application's dashboard, which interacts seamlessly with the underlying MySQL database. The use of Radix UI enhances the user interface, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience. Overall, the Ticket Tracker App serves as an efficient tool for monitoring and handling tickets with a robust tech stack for both frontend and backend development.
